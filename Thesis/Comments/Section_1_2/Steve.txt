Some general comments:

1. Some poor English, such as
Statement A, statement B
which should be either
Statement A and statement B
or
Statement A, but statement B
or
Statement A; statement B

It might be easier to get the physics and biology right and then, further down the line, we can have a Teams meeting in which things can be tidied up in real time.

2. Tense. 'The objective of this chapter WAS to determine...'
Does that mean it isn't any more? I suggest that references to the thesis should be in the present tense.

3. I suggest you start compiling a list of things that will need to be checked, towards then end of thesis writing, for consistency. For instance,

'Comprise' means 'consists of' and so you shouldn't say 'comprises of'. An easy search-and-replace.
'IR' or 'infrared' or 'infra-red'. Something you can only really check when all writing is done.
'Vice verse' should be 'vice versa'.
Many hyphens (-) should be dashes (â€“).
'tpr' or 'TPR', etc.


Specific comments:

Page23 Line9
Does anybody use W for wavenumber (rather than Greek nu)?

Figure 2.5
Needs vertical axis and Red=imaginary, Blue=real.

Page27 Line6
'Transitions corresponding to either' should be 'transitions that are either'.

Figure 2.8
Caption should have something like
'where Erot << Evib << Eelec'

Page34 Line6
'Are able to' should be 'can'

Page36 Line19
CaF should be CaF2 (subscript 2)

Page36 Last line
'Lens' should be 'mirror'

Page38 Line14
'Interface filter' should be 'interference filter'

Figure 2.12
'Position against electron energy' should be 'electron energy against position'

Page44 Line1
'Maximum' should be 'minimum'

Equation 2.38
n is not in the equation
NA values > 1 can only be achieved in refracting media (n > 1).

Is FFT defined somewhere?
