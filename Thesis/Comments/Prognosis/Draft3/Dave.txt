Hi Conor,

I'm recovering from 24 hours of covid misery, but thanks to the vaccines, that all it seems to have been, thank goodness.

Your prognosis chapter reads really well. The figures are very nice.

I'd include Janet and Peter and put them with Steve all above me on your supervisor list. I've ended up not doing very much. Janet has been a key person - thank you so much, Janet.

The Tissue Prep on page 3 - is the 29 patients the final number after applying the inclusion criteria you describe? Or the number before applying the criteria? Could you clarify this in your text.

Page 12 to 13 is some text missing? The evaluation on a patient basis doesn;t seem to continue on the next page?

The conclusion section is good, you can use that as the basis of the abstract.
